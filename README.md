# ReStore

E-Commerce site built with .NET, React &amp; Redux

# Try it out

Be sure to install .Net SDK and Runtime ([Ubuntu 22.04 Installation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu-2204))

Clone the project, cd into ReStore/API and run it with `dotnet run`, that starts the backend.

For the React part, cd into ReStore/client and run `npm run dev`, it will start vite.
